Finding optimal investment combinations for stock portfolio

There are millions of combinations of stocks you can choose to build a portfolio. Furthermore, once you have chosen your stocks, there are various ways you can distribute them in your portfolio. For example, allocating 70% of your capital in one stock and 30% in another stock. My first goal for this project is to use computing to pick the right combination of stocks (hand picked stocks) to get the desired rate of return and volatility. For the first goal, this project will use past performance to measure returns and volatility.
